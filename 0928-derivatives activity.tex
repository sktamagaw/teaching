Look at the football-shaped surface.  It should be oriented like this:
\includegraphics[height=1in]{0928-football.png}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
If the surface is given by $f(x,y)$, what  is $f_x$ at the black dot?

\vspace{0.5in}

\item
What is $f_y$ at the black dot?

\vspace{0.5in}

\item
Is $f_y$ positive or negative at the black toothpick?  How do you know?

\item
Is $f_x$ positive or negative at the black toothpick?  How do you know?

\vspace{0.5in}

\item
Is $f_{yy}$ positive or negative at the black toothpick?  How do you know?

\vspace{0.5in}


\item
Is $f_{yx}$ positive or negative at the toothpick \emph{next to} the black toothpick?  How do you know?

Now, look at the half-cylinder.  Suppose the surface is given by $g(x,y)$.
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Identify all the places where $\nabla g = \vec 0$.

\item
Identify all the places where $\nabla g = \langle 0, a \rangle$ with $a >0$.

If $\vec v= \langle 1,1 \rangle$, identify where $D_{\vec v} g$ is positive.

\item
Look at exercises (2) and (3) above.  If you wanted to find the maximum of a surface, how would you be able to do it using only the fomula without graphing it?


\vspace{1in}

\item
If you finish early, confirm your answers to (2) and (3) by calculation.  The football is approximately given by
$$f(x,y) = \sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{16} - \frac{y^2}{4}}$$
where the black dot is located near $(0,0)$ and the black toothpick is located near $(0,1)$.

The half-cylinder is approximately given by
$$g(x,y) = \sqrt{1-y^2}, \quad -2 \le x \le 2$$
where $(0,0)$ is located near the center of the surface.

Neither figure is to scale, but they do capture the general shape.
